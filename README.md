## 📌 Project Overview
Welcome to my **CPlusPlus-Basics** repository! 

This is a general-purpose collection where I document my learning journey in C++. It serves as a code archive for everything from simple variable manipulation to manual memory management. As I progress, this repository will evolve to showcase advanced **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** patterns and **Embedded Systems** logic.

## 📂 Code Archive
Here is a breakdown of the concepts currently covered in this repository:

| Category | File | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Structures** | `linkedlist.cpp` | Implementation of linked lists to practice pointers and dynamic memory. |
| **Algorithms** | `recursion.cpp` | A simple app demonstrating recursive logic (e.g., multiplication). |
| **Control Flow** | `loops.cpp` | Practice using `for` and `while` loops for iteration. |
| **Fundamentals** | `variables.cpp` | Exploration of C++ data types and storage. |
| **Basics** | `helloworld.cpp` | Standard entry point and I/O setup. |
| **Misc** | `merrychristmas.cpp` | Thematic coding practice. |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++
* **Tools:** GCC/Clang Compiler, Git
* **Focus:** Memory management, Pointers, Logic building

## 🚀 How to Run
To run any of these files locally, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/stealthcamaro/CPlusPlus-Basics.git](https://github.com/stealthcamaro/CPlusPlus-Basics.git)
    cd CPlusPlus-Basics
    ```

2.  **Compile a file (example):**
    ```bash
    g++ linkedlist.cpp -o my_program
    ```

3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./my_program
    ```

## 🔮 Future Goals
I plan to "flex" my skills by adding the following soon:
- [ ] **Object-Oriented Design:** Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- [ ] **Embedded Programming:** Bitwise operations and hardware-level constraints.
- [ ] **Advanced Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, and optimization problems.
